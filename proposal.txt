This is an updated version of the initial proposal made on:

    From: Peter Wang <novalazy@gmail.com>
    Subject: [AD] another web site proposal
    To: alleg-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

The Allegro web site is generated using Pandoc.

The parts which are common to all pages are stored in the en/INC.* files.
The initial portion of the page (title and sidebar) are generated by running
these files through Pandoc to produce HTML:

    en/INC.bodystart
    en/INC.links

The end of the page (footer) is generated from the files:

    en/INC.bodyend
    en/INC.links

The main content of each page is stored in either a single file or a directory.
A single file page like `introduction.html` is generated from these files:

    en/introduction
    en/INC.links

A page stored in a directory is generated from all the files within the
directory, e.g. the news page:

    en/news/a.header
    en/news/news.2008-11-02
    en/news/news.2008-10-01
    en/news/news.2008-09-10
    en/news/z.footer
    en/INC.links

Notice that the filenames within the directory are sorted, except that
sequences of files with dates in them are *reverse* sorted.

To create a news item, just add a new file in `en/news`.  Old news items
can be moved to `en/oldnews` periodically.

Any content run through Pandoc can be written with Markdown syntax, but you
can also insert any HTML you need.

An additional include file, en/INC.head, is inserted verbatim into the
HTML header.

That's it!  See translations.txt for information about other languages.
