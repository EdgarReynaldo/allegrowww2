# Mirrors

The Allegro web pages are mirrored on several servers. You are meant to use the
one which is closest to you geographically, or failing that, any which still
works :-)

* [SourceForge](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) -
This server hosts all the available files. Due to availability, bandwidth and
key features like CVS or automatic web updates, you can consider this server as
the main one.

* [Dotsrc](http://allegro.dotsrc.org/) -
This server hosts most of the available files.

* [Demon Internet](http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/) -
This server hosts only text files. Binary links point to another server.

* [Allegro project page at SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/) -
This is not really a mirror. This is Allegro's project page at SourceForge,
which provides different services and informations, like CVS access, mailing
lists, a bug tracker, etc.

# DJGPP mirrors

The compiler [DJGPP] is distributed through a mirror network. Since Allegro is
distributed as a package for DJGPP, you can obtain it in the .ZIP form from one
of DJGPP's mirrors. The following list of mirrors is updated every now and then
from DJGPP's zip picker page.
