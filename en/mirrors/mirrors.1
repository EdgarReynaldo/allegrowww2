The official web site.

* [Allegro project page at SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/) -
This is Allegro's project page at SourceForge.  You can access services such as
git, mailing lists, the bug tracker, etc. from here.

* [Demon Internet](http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/) -
This was the original Allegro web site.  Unfortunately it seems to be out of
date now.  This server hosts only text files.

# DJGPP mirrors

The compiler [DJGPP] is distributed through a mirror network.  *Earlier* versions
of Allegro are distributed as a package for DJGPP, and you can obtain it in the
.ZIP form from one of DJGPP's mirrors.  The following list of mirrors is
updated every now and then from DJGPP's zip picker page.
