# DJGPP mirrors

The compiler [DJGPP] is distributed through a mirror network.  *Earlier* versions
of Allegro are distributed as a package for DJGPP, and you can obtain it in the
.ZIP form from one of DJGPP's mirrors.  The following list of mirrors is
updated every now and then from DJGPP's zip picker page.
