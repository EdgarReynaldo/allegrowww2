# Subversion read access

Subversion is a replacement for good'ol CVS. You can get clients for most
platforms at <http://subversion.tigris.org/>, and there is good documentation
like the [Version control with Subversion](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
manual, by some of Subversion's authors. 

You can get read access from the main URL
<https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/>. While you can access this
link directly and will see the files, that's really boring - instead you want
to use a Subversion client to check out the whole source and make local
modifications in order to send patches. Example: 

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.2

(for the stable 4.2 branch)

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.4

(for the stable 4.4 branch)

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9

(for the unstable 4.9 branch)

You can also use a web interface to browse the repository, which you will find
at <http://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/alleg/>. The Subversion tree was
migrated from SourceForge's CVS repository, so everything you used to know
should be there (except the allegrowww module). 

If you need write access to the Subversion tree, please ask for it on the
Allegro development mailing list. 

## Changelogs of the Subversion tree

The SVN repository also has a commit hook for [CIA], a system for tracking
open-source projects in real-time. The CIA web interface provides an RSS feed
and notifications in the `#commits` channel on the [Freenode] IRC network. You
can monitor Allegro activity at <http://cia.vc/stats/project/alleg>.
