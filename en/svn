# Subversion read access

Subversion is a replacement for good'ol CVS. You can get clients for most
platforms at <http://subversion.tigris.org/>, and there is good documentation
like the [Version control with Subversion](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
manual, by some of Subversion's authors. 

You can get read access from the main URL
<https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/>. While you can access this
link directly and will see the files, that's really boring - instead you want
to use a Subversion client to check out the whole source and make local
modifications in order to send patches. Example: 

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.2

(for the stable 4.2 branch)

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9

(for the unstable 4.9 branch)

You can also use a web interface to browse the repository, which you will find
at <http://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/alleg/>. The Subversion tree was
migrated from SourceForge's CVS repository, so everything you used to know
should be there (except the allegrowww module). 

If you need write access to the Subversion tree, please ask for it on the
Allegro development mailing list. 

The snapshots of the Allegro SVN are generated dynamically only at Sourceforge,
and this means that you will have to go there to download them. Please follow
this link: <http://alleg.sourceforge.net/svn.html>.

## Changelogs of the Subversion tree

Change logs for the SVN repository are generated every hour and uploaded to the
Allegro web page at SourceForge. The xml versions are generated with the
`--verbose` switch, unlike the text versions. Note that these files include the
whole repository history since it was started, and they may be very big. 

* [ChangeLog-4.2.txt.gz](logs/ChangeLog-4.2.txt.gz)
* [ChangeLog-4.2-extract.txt](logs/ChangeLog-4.2-extract.txt) (500 lines extract)
* [ChangeLog-4.2.xml.gz](logs/ChangeLog-4.2.xml.gz)
* [ChangeLog-4.3.txt.gz](logs/ChangeLog-4.3.txt.gz)
* [ChangeLog-4.3-extract.txt](logs/ChangeLog-4.3-extract.txt) (500 lines extract)
* [ChangeLog-4.3.xml.gz](logs/ChangeLog-4.3.xml.gz)

The SVN repository also has a commit hook for [CIA], a system for tracking
open-source projects in real-time. The CIA web interface may be easier to read
than the above logs, provides an RSS feed and notifications in the `#commits`
channel on the [Freenode] IRC network. You can monitor Allegro activity at
<http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/alleg>.
