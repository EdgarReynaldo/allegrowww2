# Subversion read access

Subversion is a replacement for good'ol CVS. You can get clients for most
platforms at <http://subversion.tigris.org/>, and there is good documentation
like the [Version control with Subversion](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
manual, by some of Subversion's authors. 

You can get read access from the main URL
<https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/>. While you can access this
link directly and will see the files, that's really boring - instead you want
to use a Subversion client to check out the whole source and make local
modifications in order to send patches. Example: 

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.2

(for the stable 4.2 branch)

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.4

(for the stable 4.4 branch)

    svn co https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9

(for the unstable 4.9 branch)

If you need write access to the Subversion tree, please ask for it on the
Allegro development mailing list. 

## SVN::Web Interface

Theres's an SVN::Web interface to the SVN code at
<http://svn.tomasu.org/index.cgi/allegro>. It uses a mirror so may
only show commits up to 5 minutes later but the site may work faster
then the ViewVC accesc at Sourceforge.

## ViewVC Interface

You can use a web interface to browse the repository directly at
<http://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/alleg/>.

## Test results

Daily SVN test results can be seen here: <http://allefant.com/tests.py>

## Upstream tracker

Shallow test results from the Upstream Tracker:
<http://linuxtesting.org/upstream-tracker/versions/allegro.html>

## Changelogs of the Subversion tree

The SVN repository also has a commit hook for [CIA], a system for tracking
open-source projects in real-time. The CIA web interface provides an RSS feed
and notifications in the `#commits` channel on the [Freenode] IRC network. You
can monitor Allegro activity at <http://cia.vc/stats/project/alleg>.
