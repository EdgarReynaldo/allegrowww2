## 2015-04-12 - Ubuntu PPAs now available.

For convenience to our Ubuntu users (and those using distributions based on
Ubuntu) we now maintain two [PPAs](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas). You can
use these to install binary and development packages of Allegro 5 stable and
unstable releases. Check out the bottom of the [downloads] section for the
links.
