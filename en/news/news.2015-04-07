## 2015-04-07 - A new book about Allegro has been published!

A book introducing game programming using Allegro 5 has recently been written
by Frédéric Drouillon, titled *Allegro 5 - Programmation de jeux en C ou C++*.
This book is available in French, and will surely be a great read for the
French-speaking Allegro 5 users. For others, the code samples available for
download on the publisher's website should be of interest as well. Check out
the [books section][books] for more information.
