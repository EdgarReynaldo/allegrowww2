# Introduction

Allegro 4 and Allegro 5 are cross-platform, libraries mainly aimed at video
game and multimedia programming.  They handle common, low-level tasks such as
creating windows, accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing
sounds, etc. and generally abstracting away the underlying platform.
However, Allegro is *not* a game engine: you are free to design and structure
your program as you like.

According to the Oxford Companion to Music, Allegro is the Italian for «quick,
lively, bright». It is also a recursive acronym which stands for «Allegro Low
LEvel Game ROutines».  Allegro was started by Shawn Hargreaves in the mid-90's
but has since received contributions from hundreds of people over the net.

# Allegro 5

Allegro 5 is the latest major revision of the library, designed to take
advantage of modern hardware (e.g. hardware acceleration using 3D cards) and
operating systems.  Although it is not backwards compatible with earlier
versions, it still occupies the same niche and retains a familiar style.

Allegro 5.0 supports the following platforms:

* Unix/Linux
* Windows (MSVC, MinGW)
* MacOS X
* iPhone

Allegro 5.1 also adds support for:

* Android

You can see the functionality Allegro provides by browsing the online
[reference manual](api.html).

Allegro only supports 2D graphics primitives natively, but it is perfectly
reasonable to use Allegro alongside a 3D API (e.g. OpenGL, Direct3D, and higher
level libraries), while Allegro handles the other tasks.  Allegro is also
designed to be modular; e.g. if you prefer, you can substitute another audio
library.

# Allegro 4

Allegro 4 is the classic library, whose API is backwards compatible all the way
back to Allegro 2.0 for DOS/DJGPP (1996).  It is no longer *actively*
developed, but we still apply patches sent to us by contributors, mainly to fix
minor bugs.  Every so often we will make new releases.

Allegro 4.4 supports the following platforms:

* Unix/Linux
* Windows (MSVC, MinGW, Cygwin)
* MacOS X
* Haiku/BeOS
* PSP (currently in SVN repository only)

The older Allegro 4.2 branch additionally supports:

* Windows (Borland)
* QNX
* DOS (DJGPP, Watcom)
