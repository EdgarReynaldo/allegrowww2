# GIT access

Allegro's source code is maintained in a GIT repository. 
You can get clients for most platforms at <http://git-scm.com>, and there
is good documentation like the [Reference Manual](http://git-scm.com/docs).

The source repository is hosted at GitHub: <https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5>

You can clone the repository from either of these two URLs:

    https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5.git
    git@github.com:liballeg/allegro5.git

By default you will be on the master branch. You can change the branch from
your working tree like this:

    git checkout 5.0
    git checkout 4.4
    git checkout master

## Usage

A quick reminder how to use git.

To get the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5.git

Remember to tell git your name and email address:

    git config --global user.name "My Name"
    git config --global user.email "USERNAME@example.net"

To make sure you're in the right branch and have the latest changes:

    cd allegro
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase origin master

To locally commit your changes:

    git add -p
    git commit -v

To share your local commit (send as attachments to the Allegro developers
mailing list):

    git format-patch HEAD^


For committers, to push changes on the local master branch to the remote master branch:

    git push origin master
