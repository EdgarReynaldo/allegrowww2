# Mailing lists

There are several mailing lists related to Allegro. Some are for development
discussion, Allegro contributions, etc. Before posting on one of these lists,
please check that your mail message is appropriate for it. If you dislike or
can't use mailing lists, maybe you could try the online web forums at
[Allegro.cc](http://www.allegro.cc/forums/), where you can also get the
appropriate answers after you ask the appropriate questions.

**Important:** Make sure you understand how a mailing list works and that you
have read the instructions at the end of this page before you post any mail to
these lists. While you don't have to be subscribed to post to them, you won't
get any answers if you don't indicate that people should answer to you
directly, as by default the answers get sent to the mailing list.

[Notes about mailing list usage](#NOTES)

\[AL] Allegro (alleg-main@lists.sourceforge.net) <a name="AL"></a>
------------------------------------------------

<blockquote>
[Subscribe/Unsubscribe][1s]. [Search/Browse archives][1a].
</blockquote>

This list is for any kind of discussion about Allegro, questions about Allegro,
reports of problems with Allegro, suggestions for new features, announcements
of programs written using Allegro, etc. General rule: if it has to do with
Allegro, you can post it here. If not, go somewhere else (for example
comp.os.msdos.djgpp, comp.lang.c, or the online forums at
<http://www.allegro.cc/>).

During January of 2003 this mailing list moved to SourceForge.

\[AD] Allegro Developers (alleg-developers@lists.sourceforge.net) <a name="AD"></a>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<blockquote>
[Subscribe/Unsubscribe][2s]. [Search/Browse archives][2a].
</blockquote>

This list is for the people currently working on Allegro, who use it to
coordinate their efforts. You can use this address if you need to contact the
developers directly, for example to submit some new code that you have written
or to report a bug.

Unlike the other lists, we will be really rude to people who post inappropriate
material here, so please don't do that! Do not send tech-support questions to
this list. Don't post bug reports here unless you are 100% certain they aren't
your fault (if you are in any doubt, use the main AL list instead, which is
read by most of the same people who are subscribed here).

The Allegro development is a completely open process, and everyone is welcome
to drop by, have a listen, and start contributing code patches. This list is
for working rather than talking, though, so please don't do anything that might
get in our way.

During January of 2003 this mailing list moved to SourceForge, and
[the old archives were merged succesfully into the new location](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=689047&group_id=1&atid=200001).

\[Alleg5] Allegro 5 <a name="A5"></a>
-------------------

<blockquote>
[Search/Browse archives][3a].
</blockquote>

This list was once available for discussing the next major version of Allegro,
when it was too noisy to do so on [AD]. This is no longer the case so the list
has been shut down. However, its archives are still valuable.

\[SVN] Allegro Commits <a name="ALLEGCOMMIT"></a>
----------------------

<blockquote>
[Subscribe/Unsubscribe][4s]. [Search/Browse archives][4a].
</blockquote>

This is a read only notification mailing list. Every time a developer modifies
Allegro's cvs sources, a mail notification is sent to this list along with the
log message and the changes diff file. You can use this list to watch progress
on what is being done by who. Allegro developers are encouraged to subscribe to
this list, since not all modifications are mentioned on the AD list.

\[SVN] Allegrowww Commits <a name="ALLEGWWWCOMMIT"></a>
-------------------------

<blockquote>
[Subscribe/Unsubscribe][5s]. [Search/Browse archives][5a].
</blockquote>

This is a read only notification mailing list. Web updates are done through the
cvs allegrowww module by webmasters, and every time the web module is modified,
a mail notification is sent to this list along with the log message and the
changes diff file. You can use this list to watch progress on what is being
done by who. Allegro webmasters are encouraged to subscribe to this list in
order to know what changes in the english version, so they can update the
translations they maintain accordingly.

\[AGP] Allegro Game Programming <a name="AGP"></a>
-------------------------------

Between September 1998 and January 2003 existed the Allegro Game Programming
mailing list. This list was used by people to ask about generic game
programming problems not so closely related to Allegro. The mailing list
dropped in popularity during the last year, so it was not moved to SourceForge,
leaving the main Allegro mailing for both Allegro and generic programming
problems.

Mailing list usage <a name="NOTES"></a>
------------------

To subscribe to the SourceForge's lists, simply go to it's web page and use the
online forms to subscribe yourself. You can remove yourself from a list going
to the same page above, which can be used to remind you your password too, in
case you forgot it.

To send a message to one of the lists, write to
`alleg-main@lists.sourceforge.net` or
`alleg-developers@lists.sourceforge.net`.
You don't need to be subscribed to these mailing lists before you can post
there, but it is a good idea to subscribe in order to see the replies. Before
posting tech-support questions to the Allegro list, please take a moment to
[read the guidelines](help.html).

Notes about mailing list usage
------------------------------

Please don't send messages in HTML format. The increased size places an
unnecessary load on the server, and many subscribers have a hard time reading
these posts.

Please do not crosspost between these lists. Choose the most appropriate one
for your message, and then send it only to that list.

Please do not start new discussion threads by replying to existing ones, since
usually the subject will be wrong, and you will confuse people who have
threaded mail programs. Also, somebody may have killed a particular thread when
he thinks it's done, and won't get your post. Simply use the "new message"
option of your mail program.

Please don't send large binary attachments to any of the lists, they will be
rejected by the size limit filter, which is set to 100KB for the developers
mailing list, and 40KB for the others. Upload your files to a website and then
post the URL, or if you can't do that, post an announcement asking people to
write to you privately, and then send the file by individual email to whoever
responded.

Please use English in your messages. You could eventually post messages in
whatever language you prefer, but that would terribly limit the chances of
getting a useful answer.

Remember that the [RFC 1855: netiquette guidelines][RFC 1855] describes other
general guidelines you should follow as a correct internet user (in mailing
lists and other places as well), and provides more verbose descriptions and
explanations about why you should follow the above guidelines.

One of the important guidelines you should be aware of is how to quote
correctly the message you are replying to. The previous RFC doesn't really
explain how to do it, so you might want to read the document [How do I quote
correctly in Usenet?][learn2quote]. Quoting correctly is easier said than done,
especially for users of Microsoft Outlook. If you are such a user, you can help
yourself using the [Outlook-QuoteFix] extension written by Dominik Jain.
