# Webmasters

This web page is maintained by the following people, whom you can contact to
send comments, questions, updates or communicate mistakes. Also, if you want to
collaborate translating these web pages or mirroring them, just tell us, we
will gladly accept any help you can offer. Before doing so, however, please
take your time to read the following document, which explains how the
translations are done through SVN:
[webmaster_instructions.html](webmaster_instructions.html).  You don't need to
read all of it, just the interesting parts, like how to work with SVN and what
are the rules for translators.
