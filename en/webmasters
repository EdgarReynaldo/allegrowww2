# Webmasters

This web page is maintained by some of the people developing Allegro. You
can contact them using the [developers' mailing list](maillist.html).

Right now the web page and the mirrors are being heavily modified, with
all the translations being dropped until the dust settles and the main
page is sorted out. This means that the mirrors (both Talula and Sunsite)
will be off sync.

Thanks to [Dotsrc] and [Shawn] for the web space and [SourceForge]
for the web space and SVN server.
