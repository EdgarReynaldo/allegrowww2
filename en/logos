Welcome to the Allegro logo section. Above this text you can see the bigger
version of the top left corner logo. This logo was created with the help of
the [CoolText] web site.  You can go there and create any simple logo for your
web page, or a replica of this logo with the correct size for your Allegro
program if you want to show it as a splash screen or somewhere in your
credits.
It was created using the 128 pixels Utopia font,
<font color="#6495ed">with `#6495ed` as the text color</font> and
`#ffffff` as the hightlight color.
The top left corner logo may not look the same, but that's because the
shadows and hightlight change slightly with different font sizes.
See the little green guy to the left? He's Alex the Allegator, and
since version 4.0 he is included with Allegro in `misc/alex.xpm`.
It was drawn by [Johan Peitz].

A similar logo was created for use on the Allegro wiki. It was made in Gimp
using the free URW Bookman Italic font, and works on any background by using a
PNG with alpha channel, instead of solid white.

Anyway, people with (much) better art skills than the average
programmer have contributed in the past to the Allegro community with
different logos. The purpose of these logos is usually to be shown
somewhere in your game, or printed out in your manual, to either
promote Allegro itself or to get that cool professional look. Remember,
however, that the [license itself](license.html)
doesn't require you to tell anything about the library in your programs,
but if you want to do it, here you have a few graphics to choose from.

Use the links at the top and bottom of each page to navigate through
the different logos. Unless stated otherwise, you can use them
freely without restriction, just like you do with Allegro. If you
want to contribute to this section, please contact one of the
[webmasters](webmasters.html) to agree
on how to send the graphic. In fact, the best you can do is to put
your logo on some page and give us the URL, so that we can grab it
and add a link to your homepage too.

Oh, and by the way, below you have the Allegro logo shown in the
demo's intro flic. To the right you see another very old logo
(veteran Allegro users will probably also remember the grey page
which hosted it), which was initially used as the main logo of
the Allegro web page. Yeah, it uses only 16 colors, but we
will keep it here for all the nostalgic people of the world
who started programming games with Allegro and [DJGPP] :-).
