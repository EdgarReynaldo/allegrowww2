The following four logos were created and donated by
[Mihai Dragan](mailto:mihai.dragan@caatoosee.ro),
a [software developer](http://www.caatoosee.ro/)
who joined the Allegro community not very long ago, and wanted to give back
something in exchange for the excellent library. The logos were made with
[Gimp] and you are free to use and distribute them. In fact, if you want them
with other dimensions, colors or texts, just email him personally, since he has
the sources and can redraw them according to your suggestions.  Each logo is
sized 500x256 and weighs around 60KB. Click on the thumbnails to view the full
version.

<img src="images/al_couch.png" hspace="3" vspace="5"
    width="161" height="142" align="right"
    alt="[Al, the couch potato]"/>

[A long time ago, in a mailing list far, far
away... Peter Wang said](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/grozilla.en.html):
'*Given that we use "AL" so much, why have we not adopted a fat, drunk
[couch potato](http://www.bundyology.com/bal.html)
for a mascot?*'.  Later, Grzegorz Godlewski, being unable to forget this
sentence, asked Karol Krenski, who makes GPL pictures for different open source
projects, to draw the very same picture you can see to the right of this text.
Impressed? Hold your breath, because you can go to
[Karol's web page](http://www.inf.sgsp.edu.pl/pub/MALUNKI/ROZNE/)
to see this logo and many more, like the ones he drew for SDL or Postfix. He
also has the sources, so you could rescale this image or ask him to do any
modifications you may want.

Bruno S. Drago made the small logo to the left for one of his games and
[contributed it to the Allegro community](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3234652&forum_id=34599).
Bruno keeps working on his games, which you can find at:
<http://www.xuti.net/>.

[Jeff Katz](mailto:jeff@katzonline.net) has also contributed the logo to the
right.

   vspace="5" width="295" height="105" border=1 align="left"
   alt="[Logo by PhoenixJ]"/>
PhoenixJ made the logo to the left in Macromedia Flash. Since
the source is in vector format it can be scaled to any size (the
background color and format can consequently be changed, too). You
can visit [PhoenixJ's web page](http://www.tinsanity.net/), where you can
see more of his artwork and get his email if you want to request a
modification of this logo.
