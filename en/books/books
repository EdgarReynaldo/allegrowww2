**Some words from the author:**
*I swear that I am very happy to have achieved this piece of work.  For me the
Allegro cross-platform game programming library is like a friend.  I have been
with her since 1998 when version 3.13 began. I have never had the time to get
to know all of her secrets but, in fact, this is probably for the best and even
after all this time there still remains something to discover.  I have always
dreamed of being able to help in her technical development but in this I have
not succeeded.  And so I remain contemplative and I have done what I can: a
book in French which I hope will make her better known.*

**Some words from the author:**
*I'm really thrilled about this book, eager to see it in print, because the
language, compiler, game library, everything about it is so cool. Did I mention
that this book will come with a free compiler/editor/IDE? We're packaging
Dev-C++ with it, along with Allegro. Free they may be, but I've done more in
the first 50 pages with these tools than most "DirectX" books cover in 500
pages. For those of you who are big GBA fans, you'll definitely want to buy
this book! I'm using the same compiler and editor (for the most part, lacking
the ARM tools, of course). Dev-C++ is simply amazing!*

*Oh, one more thing, you'll be able to run the sample programs on any operating
system! How many books can claim that? I'm talking about Windows 9x/2k/Xp,
Linux, Mac OS X, BeOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, Darwin, Irix, and on and on. I'm
including on the CD-ROM, source code project support for Visual C++, Dev-C++,
and KDevelop (Linux). It is so great being able to compile and run your own
games on Windows or Linux without changing a line of code, and it's all plain
vanilla C, easy to follow, easy to understand. I know you will love it, because
I'm having a blast writing it!*

**Some words from the author:**
*The book has 4 major parts: design, coding basics, roleplaying games and
advanced topics.  The design part (ca. 130 pages) covers creativity techniques,
writing a design doc, balancing games and gameplay elements.*

*The coding basics part (ca. 340 pages) gives you some, well, basic knowledge.
How to use compilers, linkers and make. Loading images, using keyboard / mouse
and joystick with Allegro. Using timers, the gui, etc. During this part some
basic games are designed, like a simple "Simon" like memory game, a quiz game
(using the Allegro GUI) and some demos introducing sprites, animation and
sounds.*

*The roleplaying games part (ca. 150 pages) introduces tiles, scrolling of
tilebased worlds, etc. At the end of the chapter the demo game is pretty
similar to a one player Gauntlet. You can use magic, there are enemies trying
to get you, you need to find keys, potions and treasure chests - and finally
the exit to the next level.*

*The advanced tech part (ca. 150 pages) discusses isometric games, particle
systems, blending effects, page transitions, A\* pathfinding, Lua scripting and
Interviews with some developers either using Allegro or extending Allegro
(Sirocco, Ben Davis, Johan Peitz, Richard Phipps, Bob Ohannessian and Paul
Pridham).*

## Programmare un video gioco passo per passo con Allegro.h

Title:          [Programmare un video gioco passo per passo con Allegro.h][Bertinetto book]

**Some words from the author:**
*As you might gather from reading the title of this e-book, in it you will find
all the components needed to write code for a videogame of the shooter genre,
one step after the other. You won’t need an advanced knowledge of the C
language in order to complete this very simple game, just a good amount of
strong will, following each of the planned phases. The end result is assured,
covering the handling of the graphics, the audio system, the player input
(keyboard and joystick), the collision system and much more.*

*You won't even need to compile the Allegro library, since the book makes
reference to a version of Dev-C++ with Allegro.h precompiled, which you can
download from the website of the author, along with all the sources and the
book itself.*

*Every single line of code is carefully commented, in order to make each step
as clear as possible. The beginner has only to download all of the material and
start practicing to build his first, true, videogame.*
