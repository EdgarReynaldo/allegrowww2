# Humor

How boring would our lives be if we didn't have the resort of humor. The
Allegro community, apart from providing excellent game programming code,
continues to discuss strange subjects, sometimes bordering the thin line
between fiction and reality... 

## Allegro related humor

[Aliens have landed!](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/april_1st_2000.en.html)
:   One of the first April fool day jokes. Nobody knew what would come
    afterward.

[Allegro 4.0 beta](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/april_1st_2001.en.html)
:   Just when many had lost their faith and thought Allegro would stagnate
    before reaching version 4.0, Shawn came and threw some light on
    the subject.

[Proposal for Allegro's future](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/grozilla.en.html)
:   An imaginative proposal which was met with a sound silence, possibly
    meaning that everybody was in agreement. It even [spawned a
    logo](logos_03.html)...

:   With an excellent timing, Bob managed to announce the fantastic features
    of the recent fifth incarnation of Allegro, this time even with mind
    accelerated control! Could this be true?

[A new compression format](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/lzip_compression.en.html)
:   The previous release of Allegro 5 creates some uncertainty among the
    Allegro users who don't know how to handle the new
    [lzip](http://lzip.sourceforge.net/) compression format.

## Programming related humor

[Big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html)
:   A very long text which explains how sometimes software development
    resembles the slow growth of... a big ball of mud.

[rp copy]: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/resign_patterns.en.txt
[Resign Patterns][rp] - [(low quality copy)][rp copy]
:   While students in universities are taught design patterns, sooner or later
    they will meet the anti-patterns of real life.

[The Klingon programmer][kp] - [(low quality copy)][kp copy]
:   While puny little humans write buggy software, we Klingons laugh in the
    face of danger and battle with honor!  Don't forget to read [other jokes
    collected by Susan Stepney][stepney].

[pj copy]: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/programmer_jokes.en.txt
[Programmer jokes][pj] - [(low quality copy)][pj copy]
:   The title says it all, a bunch of programmer jokes. Some really worth of
    reading are the undocumented assembler instructions, the lesser-known
    programming languages or the interview with Stroustrup about the truth of
    C++.  Terrifying.

[pl copy]: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/docs/if_languages_could_speak.en.txt
[The parable of the languages][pl] - [(low quality copy)][pl copy]
:   If programming languages could speak, really speak, not just crunch bytes
    and stream bits, they would have much to say that is both wise and
    profound.  After all, the original programmers were philosophers, and
    programming languages were philosopher tools...
