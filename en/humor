# Humor

How boring would our lives be if we didn't have the resort of humor. The
Allegro community, apart from providing excellent game programming code,
continues to discuss strange subjects, sometimes bordering the thin line
between fiction and reality...

While puny little humans write buggy software, we Klingons laugh in the face of
danger and battle with honor!  Don't forget to read other jokes collected by

<br/>
The title says it all, a bunch of programmer jokes. Some really worth of
reading are the undocumented assembler instructions, the lesser-known
programming languages or the interview with Stroustrup about the truth of C++.
Terrifying.

If programming languages could speak, really speak, not just crunch bytes and
stream bits, they would have much to say that is both wise and profound. After
all, the original programmers were philosophers, and programming languages were
philosopher tools...
