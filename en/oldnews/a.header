# Older news

For practical reasons, only two years of news are kept at this page (the
current year, and the previous one). Stale news entries are pruned at the
beginning of each year. If you really need to read older entries, you might
want to check the wayback internet machine. You can also check at SourceForge's
SVN the source code of the web page, where you can retrieve older versions of
the page.
