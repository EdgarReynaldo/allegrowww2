## 2nd of July, 2006 - SVN back at SourceForge

The sourcecode of Allegro is back at SourceForge. Many thanks to BAF for
hosting our SVN repository until now, after we were forced to move away from
SourceForge since it would not provide SVN services yet last year. By now,
SourceForge provides SVN services, so we transfered our code back and hopefully
everything will keep working smoothly.
