## 20th of October, 2005 - OMG Cup contest

The uDevGames guys have decided to start the "OMG Cup" contest. The contest
will run up to the 28th of November of 2005. So if you decide to join in, you
have as little as a month and a few days. Get going! You can also read the
invitation we received from Carlos A. Camacho, stating that Allegro programmers
would be welcome. Just find somebody to compile a MacOSX binary if you don't
have a Mac.
