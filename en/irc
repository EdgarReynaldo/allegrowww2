# Allegro on IRC

If you want to get help quickly, or simply discuss programming with Allegro
with other people, join us in the FreeNode IRC network
<http://irc.freenode.net/>. We run two channels there:

## #allegro

This is the general Allegro channel, where you can discuss about anything you
like. You will find many of the allegro.cc regulars and some of the developers
there. Discussion will be related to Allegro as often as it will be not.

## #allegro-dev

This is the channel for Allegro development. Usually only the developers will
be here and discuss development issues of Allegro. This is also the channel
where monthly developer meetings are held.

## #allegro-support

This is a channel specifically created for getting help with Allegro quickly.
If you ask a question there, and nobody answers for 3 minutes, the question
will get picked up by the bots and they will notify us in #allegro about it. 

# Notes about using IRC

If you don't know how to enter the channel, you can obtain a list of servers
from <http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml>. If you are new to IRC, it is also
a good idea to read <http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml> so you can
learn quickly what are the things you shouldn't do on the channel to avoid
upsetting people. If you have problems using the Allegro library, there is a
lot of documentation you should check before coming here. You can for example
check the **Documentation** section of this web page, where you have the FAQ, help
guidelines and Allegro's documentation online.

The language used in the IRC channel is **English**. You can eventually ask
there in another language, but most of the people there understand only
English, so this would limit the richness of your conversation ;).
