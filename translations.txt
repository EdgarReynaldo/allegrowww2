Guide for translators
=====================

Generating pages for languages other than English is a two-step process.

Assume we're translating to Spanish.  First, you need to run:

    make LNG=es prepare

This create a directory of symlinks in `IN.es` which link to either the files
in `es` or `en`.

Then to actually generate the pages, run:

    make LNG=es

If any files are added or removed from `es`, you will need to repeat the
`make prepare` step.
